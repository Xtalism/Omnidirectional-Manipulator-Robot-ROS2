# Robot-Development-ROS2

Project in current development. Developing an Omnidirectional Robot with a Manipulator Robot on top of it,
LiDAR sensor and an Intel Realsense D415. I studied the system making use of control systems, direct and
inverse kinematics, MATLAB, Gazebo and Rviz.

To setup the project:

    cd ros2_ws
    source install/setup.bash

To run the project:

    ros2 run dm {program}
    ros2 launch dm {launchfile}
